# GSD State

**Active Milestone:** M008 — Legacy Data Migration (PAUSED)
**Active Milestone:** M009 — Branding & Personalization
**Active Slice:** S02 — Theme Engine
**Active Task:** T03 — Implement Dark Mode & Theme Scalability
**Phase:** Review

- D040: Upgraded AI system prompt to behave like a natural conversational partner (similar to famous chatbots) instead of a mechanical search robot.
- D041: Adopted General de Jesus College (GJC) color scheme for the installer and premium UI elements (Primary: #00401A, Secondary: #C5A059).
- D042: Selected Tauri v2 NSIS bundling for "colorized" MSI/EXE with custom branding templates.
- D043: Bundle PostgreSQL + Ollama inside NSIS installer EXE (not sidecars).
- D044: Implemented secure settings export/import for backup on external drives.

- D058: Enabled explicit `dialog` and `shell` permissions in Tauri v2 capabilities.
- D059: Implemented timestamp-based logo filenames (`logo_<ts>.webp`) to prevent Windows file locking and browser caching issues.

- D062: Implemented Firebase Auto-Sync architecture with background interval processing.
- D063: Added Sync/Logs ComboButton to the main Toolbar for manual override and status monitoring.
