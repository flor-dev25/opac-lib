## Recent Decisions
- D001: Use React + Tailwind for UI implementation (Parity-first).
- D002: Use Lucide-React for iconography (Modern equivalent).
- D003: Strictly follow beveled border styling for legacy parity.
- D004: Removed Sidebar navigation in favor of a top-heavy Toolbar to match wireframe 003-dashboard-main.
- D005: Implemented high-density DataGrid with sticky headers for catalog browsing.
- D006: Adopted Caveman plugin for communication to reduce token usage (~75% reduction).
- D007: Implemented auto-generating timestamp ID (Control No) and full bibliographic form validation.
- D008: Centralized global dialog management in MainLayout for multi-context access.
- D009: Implemented global catalogStore (Zustand) to sync selection between Dashboard and Toolbar actions.
