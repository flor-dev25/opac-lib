## Blockers
- **B002**: Awaiting final raw data export from GJC Library legacy terminal.

- D068: Architected access token lifecycle management with auto-refresh mechanism.

- D072: Integrated role-based metadata (Administrator, Librarian, etc.) into the authentication state and UI.
- D073: Repositioned both `UserProfile` and `Close` buttons to the top-right group per user request.
- D074: Implemented `DEV_DATABASE_URL` env var bypass in `settings.rs` to skip NSIS-installed `db_config.json` during development. Activated `dotenvy` in `main.rs` (was a dead dependency).
- D075: Planned M010 — Legacy Access Database Import. Pure Rust implementation via `odbc-api` crate. No Python runtime dependency.
- D076: S01 (backend) defines 6-task pipeline: auto-backup → ODBC check → MDB read → validate → transact → wire. S02 (frontend) defines 4-step import dialog (Advanced Mode only).
- D077: Implemented M010-S02 (Frontend). Added `ImportMdbDialog` and `ImportSummaryView`. Added `DatabaseBackup` icon to `Toolbar` (visible in Advanced Mode). Wired to `MainLayout`.
- D078: Fixed dark mode visibility in `ImportMdbDialog` for selected file path by using standard `input-classic` class. Verified M010 requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- D079: Planned M011 — Dual Sync Architecture. System will sync to both Firebase (NoSQL mirror) and Supabase (PostgreSQL 1:1 backup). Added `SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_URL` to `.env`.
- D080: Implemented Dual Sync toggles (Firebase/Supabase) in SettingsPage and real-time accordion-style SyncLogsDialog via Tauri events.
- D081: Architected high-performance concurrent Dual Sync using `futures_util::stream::StreamExt` (10 concurrent DB threads). Added offline fast-fail check for Supabase (`SELECT 1`). Updated Settings UI to require manual Save & Confirm for sync targets.
- D082: Resolved orphaned 'syncing' UI spinners by intercepting persisted Zustand state and failing stuck sessions. Manually seeded Supabase cloud instance via `psql` using `glDB.sanitized.sql` for baseline replication.
- D083: Mitigated PC crashing during dual sync by reducing `futures` concurrency limit from 10 to 2, preventing PostgreSQL connection pool exhaustion. Hardened UI to strictly restrict the loading spinner to `index === 0` (only the latest activity) in SyncLogsDialog, combined with active cleanup of zombie sessions on every `syncNow` trigger.
- D084: Made SyncLogsDialog header title and Tauri Rust terminal logs dynamically reflect the currently active sync targets (Firebase, Supabase, or Dual) instead of hardcoding "Firebase/Dual Synchronization".
- D085: Authored `docs/SYNC-FLOW.md` featuring a comprehensive Mermaid architecture diagram to document the complete end-to-end cloud synchronization lifecycle.
- D086: Executed UI Hardening phase: fixed dark mode visibility for AI badge, sync button, and password reveal icon. Resolved layout clipping in Financial Reports. Upgraded Authority Dialog with fixed height, real-time search, and 20-item pagination. Standardized all dialogs to use the global `TitleBar` component. Corrected Sync Button arrow clipping by overriding global padding defaults with `!px-0`.
- D087: Implemented admin-configurable Auto-Sync Scheduler. Replaced hardcoded 5-min interval with a smart 60s polling loop that checks admin-set time (24h) and day-of-week (everyday or custom). Added schedule UI to Settings (time picker, frequency mode, day selector). Implemented silent reset (schedule changes auto-apply via `useEffect` dependency). Added TODO placeholder for auto email notifications on sync activity. Updated `SYNC-FLOW.md` with Section 6 documenting the scheduler architecture, failure scenarios, and email notification roadmap.

## Caveman Mode
**Status:** Active. Fast, terse agentic execution protocol enabled.

## Next Action
- Admin Sync Scheduler: DONE.
- TODO: Auto email notification for sync activity logs (planned for future milestone).
- Await user QA feedback on scheduled sync behavior.
